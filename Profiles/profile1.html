      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        The fact that I could possibly impact a young person’s life is exciting to me.
        I do not want letter grades to be as important as growing characteristics in a student.
        My primary reason why I have decided to pursue this career is because
        I feel the strong desire to positively influence and educate children.
        I feel that one of the major satisfactions of being a teacher is to enrich a student’s life.
        This is a very profound and satisfying way to spend a day at work. I recognize that patience,
        understanding, compassion, and sensitivity are essential to this profession, which
        I am wholeheartedly prepared to provide.
      </p>

    <div id="experience">
      <h1>Experience</h1>
      <p>
        My academic experiences, volunteer experiences as well as my experience in theworkforce have fostered a tremendous
        personal drive, and have helped me to becomean independent, self-suf􀁽cient, and hardworking individual.
        I have worked part-time,with a full course load during every semester, and have maintained a B average.
        Myexperiences have taught me a great deal of discipline and time management, whichare essential in the teaching
        profession. Balancing numerous activities with my schoollife, family, and social life has provided me with a
        lot of experience with prioritizationand has made me very effcient.
        I am greatly concerned about my community, andfeel that as a teacher, I will be able to give something back.
        In my third year as aHuman Development student at California State East Bay, I had the opportunity ofundergoing a
        full semester of 􀁽eld experience as part of a pilot project.
        I wasresponsible for planning and implementing stimulating lessons for a class withdiverse needs.
      </p>

    <div id="skills">
      <h1>Skills</h1>
      <p>
        I have the ability to adapt my teaching method in order to the needs of the learner.Problem solving is another
        skill that is crucial to being a good teacher. I have learnedthrough experience that there is always more than
        one way to solve a problem. If Icannot solve a problem using my own resources,
        I will talk to other individuals in the􀁽eld to get new ideas, and consult current research.
        I believe that I possess insight and determination that I can offer to my students.
        I would be an asset to the schooland ultimately an asset to the profession.
        I believe that I will be able to help all mystudents reach their optimal potential.
